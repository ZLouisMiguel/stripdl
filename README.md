## What it is

Strip is two things that work together:

- **`stripdl`** — a Python CLI that downloads entire webtoon series from Webtoons.com, saving each chapter as a folder of images with full resume support
- **Strip Reader** — an Electron + React desktop app that reads your local library with a smooth, scrolling reader interface

Downloads are stored in a clean folder structure on your machine. No account, no DRM, no internet connection needed to read.

## The app

Strip Reader is a three-panel desktop app built on Electron:

**Library** — a card grid of every series you have downloaded. Search by title, sort by name, last read, or chapter count, and right-click any series for quick actions (open folder, delete, mark read). Clicking a series opens its chapter list.

**Reader** — a vertical scrolling reader, identical to reading on the web. Images lazy-load as you scroll and the next chapter is preloaded in the background so chapter transitions are instant. Navigate with the toolbar or keyboard shortcuts (`j` / `k`, `n` / `p`, `b` to go back, `g` to jump to a chapter).

**Settings** — grouped configuration cards:

- _Storage_ — download directory
- _Downloads_ — concurrent chapters, concurrent images per chapter, request rate limit
- _Reader_ — lazy loading toggle, preload next chapter toggle
- _Appearance_ — light / dark / system theme

**Download tray** — a persistent bottom drawer that handles downloads without navigating away from what you're reading. Paste a URL, hit start, and a live progress card appears showing per-chapter progress bars with page counts. Multiple jobs queue automatically. The tray stays open across navigation and collapses to a badge when minimised.

**Auto-download** — subscribe any series to specific weekdays (e.g. "every Thursday") from its detail page, and Strip checks for new chapters and downloads them automatically in the background while the app is open, notifying you when something new arrives.

## Quick start

### CLI

```bash
cd core
pip install -e .

# Full series — oldest chapter first
stripdl download "https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/tower-of-god/list?title_no=95"

# From chapter 50 onwards
stripdl download "https://www.webtoons.com/en/..." --start 50

# Specific range or episodes
stripdl download "https://www.webtoons.com/en/..." --chapters 1-20
stripdl download "https://www.webtoons.com/en/..." --chapters 1,5,10

# Browse what's available without downloading
stripdl list "https://www.webtoons.com/en/..."

# Your local library
stripdl library

# Configuration
stripdl config
stripdl config --set download_dir=D:\Comics
stripdl config --set image_quality=90
```

### Reader app

```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.9+, Node.js 18+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/strip.git
cd strip

# CLI (package lives under core/)
cd core
pip install -e .
cd ..

# Reader
cd desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How it works

### Download pipeline

The CLI fetches the chapter list and downloads images concurrently in a pipeline — chapter 1 starts downloading as soon as the first page of the chapter list arrives, without waiting for the full list:

background thread download pool (3 workers)
───────────────── ─────────────────────────
iter_chapter_list()
page 1 fetched ──► sort ascending ──► chapter 1 starts
page 2 fetched ──► push to queue ──► chapter 2 starts
page 3 fetched ──► push to queue ──► chapter 3 starts
...

Within each chapter, images are downloaded concurrently (4 threads by default) through a shared session with automatic connection retry and exponential backoff.

> **Note:** discovery and downloading are not fully pipelined in the current implementation — every chapter is discovered and sorted ascending by chapter number _before_ any of them are queued for download, so that resuming a series always restarts from chapter 1 rather than whatever chapter Webtoons happens to list first (Webtoons returns chapters newest-first). The diagram above describes the intended/target architecture; see the comment block at the top of `core/strip/downloader.py` for the current behavior and the trade-off involved.

### Resume

Interrupted downloads resume cleanly. Each chapter directory gets a `.complete` sentinel once all images are saved. On the next run, complete chapters are skipped entirely and only missing images within partial chapters are re-fetched.

### Electron ↔ CLI communication

The reader spawns the CLI as a child process for downloads and reads the library directly from disk — no server required:

Electron renderer → main process → spawn stripdl --json-progress
↓ stdout JSON lines
main process → ipcRenderer → Electron renderer

JSON event stream (subset):

```jsonc
{"status": "series_info",   "title": "Tower of God", "author": "SIU"}
{"status": "chapter_found", "chapter": 1, "title": "Ch. 1", "count": 1}
{"status": "chapter_start", "chapter": 1, "total_pages": 64}
{"status": "progress",      "chapter": 1, "page": 12, "percent": 19}
{"status": "chapter_done",  "chapter": 1, "pages_saved": 64}
{"status": "done",          "series": "Tower of God", "directory": "..."}
```

### Local image access

Cover images and chapter pages are served to the renderer through a custom `strip-file://` protocol registered in the main process, rather than plain `file://` URLs — this keeps local images loading correctly both in development (where the renderer runs on Vite's dev server, an `http://` origin) and in a packaged build alike.

## Folder structure

~/strip-data/
└── Tower_of_God/
├── metadata.json ← title, author, description, cover URL
├── cover.jpg
├── 001/
│ ├── metadata.json ← chapter number, title, date
│ ├── .complete ← written when chapter finishes (resume sentinel)
│ ├── 001_001.jpg
│ ├── 001_002.jpg
│ └── ...
└── 002/
└── ...

Half-chapters (e.g. episode 12.5) get their own distinct folder, e.g. `012_5/`, rather than sharing a folder with chapter 12.

## Download options

stripdl download [OPTIONS] URL

| Option                    | Short | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--chapters RANGE`        | `-c`  | Range `1-20` or comma list `1,3,5`                             |
| `--start N`               | `-s`  | Download from chapter N through the latest                     |
| `--output PATH`           | `-o`  | Override download directory for this run                       |
| `--chapter-concurrency N` |       | Parallel chapters (default: 3)                                 |
| `--image-concurrency N`   |       | Parallel images per chapter (default: 4)                       |
| `--rate-limit N`          |       | Max requests/sec across all threads (default: 8)               |
| `--cache-ttl N`           |       | Days to reuse cached series metadata for this run (default: 7) |
| `--no-cache`              |       | Ignore cached series metadata; shorthand for `--cache-ttl 0`   |
| `--overwrite`             |       | Re-download chapters even if already marked complete           |
| `--verify`                |       | SHA-256 integrity check after each image                       |

`--chapters` and `--start` are mutually exclusive. Without either, all chapters download from chapter 1.

## Adding support for new sites

1. Create `core/strip/parsers/mysite.py` subclassing `SiteParser`
2. Implement the required methods
3. Register in `core/strip/parsers/__init__.py`

```python
from strip.parsers.base import SiteParser, SeriesInfo, ChapterInfo

class MySiteParser(SiteParser):
    @classmethod
    def supports(cls, url: str) -> bool:
        return "mysite.com" in url

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "MySite"

    def get_series_info(self, url: str) -> SeriesInfo: ...
    def get_chapter_list(self, url: str) -> list[ChapterInfo]: ...
    def get_chapter_images(self, chapter_url: str) -> list[str]: ...
    def get_image_headers(self) -> dict: ...
```

Optionally add `iter_chapter_list(url)` as a generator that yields `ChapterInfo` objects one page at a time. The downloader uses it to pipeline list fetching with downloading. Falls back to `get_chapter_list` if not implemented.

## Building a distributable

```bash
# Bundle the CLI into a single executable (auto-installs PyInstaller if needed)
python build_cli.py
# → dist/stripdl.exe  (Windows)
# → dist/stripdl      (macOS / Linux)
# → also copied to desktop/resources/strip-cli/

# Package the full desktop app
cd desktop
npm run build        # current platform
npm run build:win    # Windows  (.exe installer)
npm run build:mac    # macOS    (.dmg)
npm run build:linux  # Linux    (.AppImage)
```

## Platform notes

| Platform | Note                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | CLI named `stripdl` to avoid conflict with GNU Binutils `strip.exe`                                                                                                     |
| Windows  | Local images served via the `strip-file://` protocol (see "How it works" above) rather than `file://`, which avoids a Windows-specific drive-letter URL-parsing pitfall |

Commit message:

docs(readme): split changelog into CHANGELOG.md; add CLI banner; misc accuracy fixes

- Add the actual stripdl CLI startup banner (verbatim from cli.py's
  group docstring) as a code block near the top of the README, so it
  doubles as a preview of what running the tool looks like.
- Remove the Changelog section — full history now lives in the new
  CHANGELOG.md, linked from Contributing.
- Update "Reader app" quick-start from `npm start` (now runs
  electron-vite preview, i.e. the built app) to `npm run dev` (the
  actual dev-server command as of the electron-vite migration).
- Add brief "Auto-download" bullet under The app, and a short "Local
  image access" note under How it works, describing the strip-file://
  protocol and why it exists — both features/fixes landed since the
  README was last touched but weren't documented here.
- Platform notes: replace the stale file:// forward-slash note (no
  longer accurate — images are served via strip-file:// now) with a
  note on why that protocol is used on Windows specifically.
